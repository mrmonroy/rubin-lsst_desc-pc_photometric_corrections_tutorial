These spectra are part of the data obtained by the Center for
Astrophysics supernova program (R.P. Kirshner, PI).  The paper
describing the data (with the full data table) can be found on

These are two-column ASCII files, wavelength in column 1 (in
Angstroms) and flux in column 2 (in f_lambda, erg/s/cm^2/A, scaled up
by a factor of 10^15).  The UT date of observation is in the name of
the file.  Data not obtained with the FAST spectrograph at the
F.L. Whipple Observatory is indicated with the other telescope name in
the file name, usually the MMT.  Observational details can be found in
the data table accompanying the data.

The spectra have been scaled, where possible, to match the V-Band
photometry of Jha, S., et al. 2006, AJ, 131, 527.  Some spectra fall
outside the time frame of the photometry, or in sparsely sampled
regions, so the flux may not be completely accurate as a result of
extrapolation or interpolation errors.  This is frequently the case
for spectra well past maximum.  Note that SN 2001V and SN 2000cx have
not been scaled at all.

The spectra have only been flux and wavelength calibrated.  No attempt
has been made to deredden the spectra or to remove the recession
velocity of the host galaxy.
